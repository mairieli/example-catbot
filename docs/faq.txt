Q: What is a domestic cat?
A: A domestic cat is a small carnivorous mammal that has lived with humans for thousands of years. It belongs to the species Felis catus and is kept both as a companion animal and as a pest controller.

Q: Where do domestic cats come from?
A: Genetic studies indicate that domestic cats originate from the Near Eastern wildcat, Felis lybica. Evidence from archaeology shows early domestication in the Middle East, where cats lived near early farming communities.

Q: Why did early human societies keep cats?
A: Cats were useful for controlling rodents near stored grain. Over time, they became tolerated and later welcomed in homes. Their behaviour also made them suitable companions.

Q: When did cats start to appear in households?
A: Domesticated cats appear in archaeological sites dating back roughly nine thousand years. In ancient Egypt they were widely admired and appear frequently in art and burial sites.

Q: How did cats spread worldwide?
A: Cats travelled along trade routes on ships, where they helped control rodents. This allowed them to reach Europe, Asia and later the Americas.

Q: Are all cats part of the same species?
A: Yes. Despite the many varieties seen today, all domestic cats belong to Felis catus.

Q: What is a cat breed?
A: A cat breed is a group of cats with consistent physical traits that result from selective breeding or natural isolation. Examples include differences in coat length, colour patterns, ear shape or tail form.

Q: How many cat breeds exist?
A: The exact number differs across registries. Each registry recognises its own set of breeds. New breeds can also be proposed and evaluated.

Q: What makes breeds different from ordinary mixed cats?
A: Breeds have recorded ancestry and defined traits that appear reliably in offspring. Mixed cats do not follow an organised breeding programme.

Q: Are some breeds naturally occurring?
A: Yes. Some breeds arise from local populations that developed their traits without deliberate breeding by humans. Others were created through structured programmes.

Q: Do breeds differ in behaviour?
A: Some breeds show typical behavioural tendencies, such as higher activity or stronger social behaviour with humans. These traits are not absolute and can vary by individual.

Q: Do breeds have different grooming needs?
A: Yes. Long haired breeds need more frequent brushing to prevent matting. Short haired breeds usually require less maintenance.

Q: Do breeds vary in health concerns?
A: Some breeds carry inherited conditions that require screening. Mixed cats can also develop health issues, but certain conditions show higher frequency in specific breeds.

Q: What is the Ragdoll breed?
A: The Ragdoll is a large cat with a colour point coat pattern and blue eyes. It is known for calm behaviour and a semi long coat.

Q: What is the Maine Coon?
A: The Maine Coon is one of the largest domestic breeds. It has a heavy coat suitable for cold climates and is known for friendly behaviour.

Q: What is the British Shorthair?
A: The British Shorthair has a round face, dense coat and muscular body. It tends to have a steady and relaxed temperament.

Q: What is the Siamese cat?
A: The Siamese has a slender body, short coat and striking colour point pattern with blue eyes. It is often vocal and strongly attached to human companions.

Q: What is a natural breed?
A: A natural breed develops within a region without extensive human design. The traits appear through local adaptation. Examples include the Turkish Van and the Norwegian Forest Cat.

Q: Are mixed breed cats healthy?
A: Many mixed breed cats are healthy and live long lives. Diversity in ancestry can reduce the chance of certain inherited conditions.

Q: How long do cats live?
A: Indoor cats often live between twelve and eighteen years, and many reach their twenties. Lifespan can vary by health, environment and care.

Q: Are cats social animals?
A: Cats can form strong bonds with humans and other animals. Some prefer more independence, while others seek frequent interaction.

Q: What do cats eat?
A: Cats are obligate carnivores. They require nutrients found in animal protein. Commercial cat food is formulated to meet these needs.

Q: Why do cats purr?
A: Cats purr in various situations, such as during relaxation or when seeking comfort. Purring can also occur when a cat is stressed and trying to self soothe.

Q: How do cats communicate?
A: Cats use vocal sounds, body posture, tail movement, ear position and scent signals to communicate with humans and other animals.

Q: Why do some cats have long hair and others short hair?
A: Coat length is influenced by genetic factors. Selective breeding and natural adaptation both shaped coat variation.
