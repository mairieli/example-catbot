# CatBot example
This is an example created for the HICoDE course. 

If you would like to run the chatbot, please follow the steps below. It is recommended to use GitHub codespaces.

### Steps

1. **Create a Codespace:**
   - Click on the green "Code" button on this page, then scroll down to "Codespaces".
   - Click on "Create codespace on main".

2. **Set Up Environment:**
   - In the codespace, rename the `.env.example` file from this repo to `.env` and add your license key to that file.
     ```
     RASA_PRO_LICENSE='your_rasa_pro_license_key_here'
     OPENAI_API_KEY='your_rasa_pro_license_key_here'
     ```
   - Set this environment variables by running 
     ```
     source .env
     ```
   - Activate your python environment by running
     ```
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Requirements**
   - In the terminal, run:
     ```
     uv pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

4. **Train the Model:**
   - In the terminal, run:
     ```
     rasa train
     ```

5. **Talk to your Bot:**
   - In the terminal, run
     ```
     rasa inspect
     ```
     GitHub will show a notification, click on the green button to view the inspector where you can chat with your assistant.

6. **Run Custom Actions:**
  In Rasa 3.10 and later, custom actions are automatically run as part of your running assistant. To double-check that this is set up correctly, ensure that your `endpoints.yml` file contains the following configuration:
   ```
   action_endpoint:
      actions_module: "actions" # path to your actions package
    ```
   Then re-run your assistant via `rasa inspect` every time you make changes to your custom actions.
